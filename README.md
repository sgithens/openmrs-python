openmrs-python
==============

Python and Django utilities for working with OpenMRS

Usage
=====

* Add "openmrs-python" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
  INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          'openmrs-python',
  )

* At the moment I haven't tried using syncdb, because I assume the tables
  were created with OpenMRS
